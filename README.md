## Project Description

Soil Farming Agent is a web application designed to bridge the gap between farmers and agricultural experts by providing valuable information about soil types and their suitability for different crops. The platform helps farmers make informed decisions about what to plant and where to source their seeds.

**Key Objectives**:
- Educate farmers about different soil types
- Provide information about crops suitable for each soil type
- Connect farmers with seed and crop distributors
- Offer an admin interface for managing content

## Features

### User Features
- User registration and login
- View detailed information about different soil types
- See suitable crops for each soil type
- Browse seed/crop distributor details

### Admin Features
- Add new soil types with descriptions and suitable crops
- Add new distributor information
- Manage application content

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - JavaScript (ES6)
- **Data Storage**:
  - localStorage (for demonstration purposes)
- **Version Control**:
  - Git
  - GitHub

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/soil-farming-agent.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd soil-farming-agent
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

### For Users
1. Register for an account or login if you already have one
2. Browse the soil types to learn about their characteristics
3. Check which crops are suitable for each soil type
4. Find distributors in your area for seeds and plants

### For Admins
1. Login with admin credentials (default: admin@soil.com / admin123)
2. Access the Admin Panel from the navigation
3. Add new soil types with descriptions and suitable crops
